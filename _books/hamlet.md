In this new edition of *Hamlet*, the beauty of the page reflects the beauty of Shakespeare's words. The complete text of the play is presented in a layout that is easy to read, including line numbers for easy navigation and reference. A full prose retelling of the tragedy is included before the text for anyone who would like a more condensed version of the plot.
